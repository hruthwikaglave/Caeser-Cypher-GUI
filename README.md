# Caeser-Cypher-GUI

A Caesar Cipher Tool with Tkinter GUI

This project offers a user-friendly implementation of the classic Caesar cipher algorithm.  Key features include:

Tkinter Interface: An intuitive graphical interface for inputting messages, adjusting the shift value (1-25), and initiating encryption/decryption.
Encryption/Decryption: Robust functions to perform Caesar cipher operations, handling both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Error Handling: Includes basic input validation to guide users.
Educational: The code is commented to explain the cipher logic and Tkinter usage, making it suitable for learning purposes.
Customizable: Easily adapt the appearance of the GUI by modifying the color variables.
This project is a great starting point for understanding the Caesar cipher and exploring GUI development with Tkinter in Python.
